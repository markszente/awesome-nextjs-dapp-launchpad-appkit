# Awesome Next.js + dApp Launchpad + AppKit

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project meant as a drop-in replacement for [dApp Launchpad](https://github.com/0xPolygon/dapp-launchpad)'s frontend subproject with [AppKit](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/overview) integration.

## Why

I love dApp Launchpad, however, its frontend dependencies are not the most recent. I wanted to use the latest Next.js and Appkit, while still leveraging the awesomeness of dApp Launchpad.

## How

Simply replace your `frontend` folder with this project, and make sure to add an `.env` file based on the `.env.example`. That's it, run `dapp-launchpad dev` as you normally would.

## Where is the message wall example? :(

I just didn't copy it over. RPs are welcome if you would like to see it added. Would be nice for full compatibility.
